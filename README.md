# Excel formula and functions

A sales data set was provided by my tutor and i was asked to perform some tasks like sum, average, getting mininum and maximum values, getting the number of records in the data set, creating a column bearing the first two letters of countries, differentiating profit into 'High' and 'Low' based on the average profit as practice.

Attached below is my 'worked on' Microsoft Excel file.
